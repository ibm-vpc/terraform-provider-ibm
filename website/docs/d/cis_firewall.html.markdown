# ibm_cis_firewall

Imports a read only copy of an existing Internet Services Firewall resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ibm_cis_firewall" "lockdown" {
  cis_id    = ibm_cis.instance.id
  domain_id = ibm_cis_domain.example.id
  firewall_type = "lockdowns"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `cis_id` - (Required,string) The ID of the CIS service instance
- `domain_id` - (Required,string) The ID of the domain to add the Lockdown.
- `firewall_type` - (Required,string) The type of firewall. Allowable values are [`lockdowns`],[`access_rules`],[`ua_rules`].

**NOTE:**

1. [`access_rules`]: Access Rules are a way to allow, challenge, or block requests to your website. You can apply access rules to one domain only or all domains in the same service instance.
2. [`ua_rules`]: Perform access control when matching the exact UserAgent reported by the client. The access control mechanisms can be defined within a rule to help manage traffic from particular clients. This will enable you to customize the access to your site.
3. [`lockdowns`]: Lock access to URLs in this domain to only permitted addresses or address ranges.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The record ID. It is a combination of <`firewall_type`>,<`lockdown_id`>,<`domain_id`>,<`cis_id`> attributes concatenated with ":".

    - `value` - IP addresses or CIDR.
- `access_rule` - Access rule to be created. It is the data describing access rule.
  - `access_rule_id` - The access rule ID.
