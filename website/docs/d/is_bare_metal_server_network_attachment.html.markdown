# ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about an is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment" "is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment" {
	bare_metal_server_id = ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment.is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment.bare_metal_server_id
	id = "id"
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

- `bare_metal_server_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The bare metal server identifier.
- `id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The network attachment identifier.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

- `id` - The unique identifier of the is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment.
- `allow_to_float` - (Boolean) Indicates if the network attachment can automatically float to any other server within the same `resource_group`. The network attachment will float automatically if the network detects a GARP or RARP on another bare metal server in the resource group. Applies only to network attachments with `vlan` interface type.

  - Constraints: The minimum length is `0` items.

- `bare_metal_server_network_attachment_id` - (String) The unique identifier for this network attachment.

- `href` - (String) The URL for this network attachment.
  - Constraints: The maximum length is `8000` characters. The minimum length is `10` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^http(s)?:\/\/([^\/?#]*)([^?#]*)(\\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?$/`.

- `interface_type` - (String) The network attachment's interface type:- `hipersocket`: a virtual network device that provides high-speed TCP/IP connectivity  within a `s390x` based system- `pci`: a physical PCI device which can only be created or deleted when the bare metal  server is stopped  - Has an `allowed_vlans` property which controls the VLANs that will be permitted    to use the PCI attachment  - Cannot directly use an IEEE 802.1q VLAN tag.- `vlan`: a virtual device, used through a `pci` device that has the `vlan` in its  array of `allowed_vlans`.  - Must use an IEEE 802.1q tag.The enumerated values for this property are expected to expand in the future. When processing this property, check for and log unknown values. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the resource on which the unexpected property value was encountered.
