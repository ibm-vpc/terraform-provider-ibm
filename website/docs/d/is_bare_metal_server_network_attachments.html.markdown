# ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_attachments

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a BareMetalServerNetworkAttachmentCollection. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_attachments" "is_bare_metal_server_network_attachments" {
	bare_metal_server_id = ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment.is_bare_metal_server_network_attachment.bare_metal_server_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `bare_metal_server_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The bare metal server identifier.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z_]+$/`.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the BareMetalServerNetworkAttachmentCollection.
* `first` - (List) A link to the first page of resources.
Nested schema for **first**:
	* `href` - (String) The URL for a page of resources.
	  * Constraints: The value must match regular expression `/^http(s)?:\/\/([^\/?#]*)([^?#]*)(\\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?$/`.
