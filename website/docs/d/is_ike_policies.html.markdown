# ibm_is_ike_policies

Provides a read-only data source for IKEPolicyCollection. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax. For more information, about managing IBM Cloud VPN Gateway and IKE policy , see [about site-to-site VPN gateways](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn&interface=ui#policy-negotiation).

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_is_ike_policies" "example" {
}
```


## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `ike_policies` - (List) Collection of IKE policies.

  	Nested scheme for **ike_policies**:
 - `authentication_algorithm` - (String) The authentication algorithm.
 - `authentication_algorithms` - (List) The authentication algorithms to use for IKE Negotiation.The order of the algorithms in this array indicates their priority for negotiation, with each algorithm having priority over the one after it. Constraints: Allowable list items are: `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`. The maximum length is `3` items. The minimum length is `1` item.
 - `cipher_mode` - (String) The IKE policy cipher mode:- `singular`: A mode where `authentication_algorithm`, `dh_group` and`encryption_algorithm` each have one value.- `suite`: A mode where `authentication_algorithms`, `dh_groups` and`encryption_algorithms` each have an ordered array of values. Constraints: Allowable values are: `singular`, `suite`.
 - `connections` - (List) The VPN gateway connections that use this IKE policy.

	  	Nested scheme for **connections**:
		- `deleted` - (List) If present, this property indicates the referenced resource has been deleted and providessome supplementary information.

		  	Nested scheme for **deleted**:
			- `more_info` - (String) Link to documentation about deleted resources.
		- `href` - (String) The VPN connection's canonical URL.
		- `id` - (String) The unique identifier for this VPN gateway connection.
		- `name` - (String) The user-defined name for this VPN connection.
		- `resource_type` - (String) The resource type.
	- `created_at` - (String) The date and time that this IKE policy was created.
	- `dh_group` - (Integer) The Diffie-Hellman group.
	- `dh_groups` - (List) The Diffie-Hellman groups to use for IKE negotiation.The order of the Diffie-Hellman groups in this array indicates their priority for negotiation, with each Diffie-Hellman group having priority over the one after it. Constraints: Allowable list items are: `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `19`, `20`, `21`, `22`, `23`, `24`, `31`. The maximum length is `12` items. The minimum length is `1` item.
	- `encryption_algorithm` - (String) The encryption algorithm.
	- `encryption_algorithms` - (List) The encryption algorithms to use for IKE Negotiation.The order of the algorithms in this array indicates their priority for negotiation, with each algorithm having priority over the one after it. Constraints: Allowable list items are: `aes128`, `aes192`, `aes256`. The maximum length is `3` items. The minimum length is `1` item.
	- `href` - (String) The IKE policy's canonical URL.
	- `id` - (String) The unique identifier for this IKE policy.
	- `ike_version` - (Integer) The IKE protocol version.
	- `key_lifetime` - (Integer) The key lifetime in seconds.
	- `name` - (String) The user-defined name for this IKE policy.
	- `negotiation_mode` - (String) The IKE negotiation mode. Only `main` is supported.
	- `resource_group` - (List) The resource group object, for this IKE policy.

	  	Nested scheme for **resource_group**:
		- `href` - (String) The URL for this resource group.
		- `id` - (String) The unique identifier for this resource group.
		- `name` - (String) The user-defined name for this resource group.
	- `resource_type` - (String) The resource type.
