# ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateway
Retrieve information of an existing IBM Cloud Infrastructure virtual endpoint gateway as a read-only data source. For more information, about the VPC endpoint gateway, see [creating an endpoint gateway](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ordering-endpoint-gateway).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateway" "example" {
  name = ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateway.example.name
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source. 

- `name` - (Required, String) The endpoint gateway name.

## Attribute reference
In addition to the argument reference list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created. 

- `access_tags`  - (List) Access management tags associated for the virtual endpoint gateway.

- `allow_dns_resolution_binding` - (**Deprecated**, Optional, bool) **This field has been deprecated in favor of `dns_resolution_binding_mode` and will be removed in a future version.** 
  
  Previously indicated whether to allow this endpoint gateway to participate in DNS resolution bindings with a VPC that has dns.enable_hub set to true.
  
  **Migration Guide:**
  - `false` → use `dns_resolution_binding_mode = "disabled"`
  - `true` → use `dns_resolution_binding_mode = "primary"`
  
  **Note:** The new `dns_resolution_binding_mode` field also supports `"per_resource_binding"` for advanced DNS sharing scenarios not available with this boolean field.
  
  ~> **Important:** Do not use both `allow_dns_resolution_binding` and `dns_resolution_binding_mode` in the same configuration. Use only `dns_resolution_binding_mode`.
- `created_at` - (Timestamp) The created date and time of the endpoint gateway.
- `crn` - (String) The CRN for this endpoint gateway.
- `dns_resolution_binding_mode` - (String) The DNS resolution binding mode used for this endpoint gateway:- `disabled`: The endpoint gateway is not participating in [DNS sharing for VPE   gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-dns-sharing).- `primary`: The endpoint gateway is participating in [DNS sharing for VPE gateways]   (/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-dns-sharing) if the VPC this endpoint gateway resides in   has a DNS resolution binding to another VPC.- `per_resource_binding`: The endpoint gateway is participating in [DNS sharing for VPE   gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-dns-sharing) if the VPC this endpoint gateway   resides in has a DNS resolution binding to another VPC, and resource binding is   enabled for the `target` service.
  - Constraints: Allowable values are: `disabled`, `per_resource_binding`, `primary`.
- `health_state` - (String) Endpoint gateway health state. `ok: Healthy`, `degraded: Suffering from compromised performance, capacity, or connectivity`, `faulted: Completely unreachable, inoperative, or entirely incapacitated`, `inapplicable: The health state does not apply because of the current lifecycle state`. A resource with a lifecycle state of failed or deleting will have a health state of inapplicable. A pending resource may have this state.
- `lifecycle_state` - (String) The endpoint gateway lifecycle state, supported values are **deleted**, **deleting**, **failed**, **pending**, **stable**, **updating**, **waiting**, **suspended**.
- `ips` - (List) The unique identifier for the reserved IP.

  Nested scheme for `ips`:
  - `address` - (String) The endpoint gateway IP Address.
  - `id` - (String) The collection of reserved IPs bound to an endpoint gateway.
  - `name` - (String) The user defined or system provided name of the resource IP.
  - `resource_type` - (String) The endpoint gateway IP resource type.
- `resource_group` - (String) The unique identifier for the resource group.
- `target` - (List) The endpoint gateway target.

  Nested scheme for `target`:
  - `crn` - (String) The target CRN.
  - `name` - (String) The target name.
  - `resource_type` - (String) The resource type of the subnet reserved IP.
- `vpc` - (String) The VPC ID.
- `security_groups` (List) - The security groups to use for this endpoint gateway.
- `service_endpoints`- (Array of Strings) The fully qualified domain names for the target service. A fully qualified domain name for the target service
