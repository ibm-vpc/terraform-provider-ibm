# ibm_is_volume_jobs

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a VolumeJobCollection. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_is_volume_jobs" "is_volume_jobs" {
	volume_id = ibm_is_volume_job.is_volume_job_instance.volume_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

- `volume_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The volume identifier.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z_]+$/`.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

- `id` - The unique identifier of the VolumeJobCollection.
- `jobs` - (List) The jobs for this volume.
	Nested schema for **jobs**:
	- `auto_delete` - (Boolean) Indicates whether this volume job will be automatically deleted after it completes. At present, this is always `false`, but may be modifiable in the future.
	- `completed_at` - (String) The date and time that the volume job was completed.If absent, the volume job has not yet completed.
	- `created_at` - (String) The date and time that the volume job was created.
	- `estimated_completion_at` - (String) The date and time that the volume job is estimated to complete.If absent, the volume job is still queued and has not yet started.
	- `href` - (String) The URL for this volume job.
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `8000` characters. The minimum length is `10` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^http(s)?:\/\/([^\/?#]*)([^?#]*)(\\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?$/`.
	- `id` - (String) The unique identifier for this volume job.
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z_]+$/`.
	- `job_type` - (String) The type of volume job.The enumerated values for this property may[expand](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/vpc#property-value-expansion) in the future.
	  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `migrate`. The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*$/`.
	- `name` - (String) The name for this volume job. The name must not be used by another volume job for this volume.
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `63` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^([a-z]|[a-z][-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9]|[0-9][-a-z0-9]*([a-z]|[-a-z][-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9]))$/`.
	- `parameters` - (List) The parameters to use after the volume is migrated.
		Nested schema for **parameters**:
		- `bandwidth` - (Integer) The maximum bandwidth (in megabits per second) for the volume.If specified, the volume profile must not have a `bandwidth.type` of `dependent`.
		  * Constraints: The maximum value is `8192`. The minimum value is `1000`.
		- `iops` - (Integer) The maximum I/O operations per second (IOPS) for this volume.If specified, the volume profile must not have a `iops.type` of `dependent`.
		- `profile` - (List) Identifies a volume profile by a unique property.
			Nested schema for **profile**:
			- `href` - (String) The URL for this volume profile.
			  * Constraints: The maximum length is `8000` characters. The minimum length is `10` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^http(s)?:\/\/([^\/?#]*)([^?#]*)(\\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?$/`.
			- `name` - (String) The globally unique name for this volume profile.
			  * Constraints: The maximum length is `63` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^([a-z]|[a-z][-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9]|[0-9][-a-z0-9]*([a-z]|[-a-z][-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9]))$/`.
	- `resource_type` - (String) The resource type.
	  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `volume_job`. The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*$/`.
	- `started_at` - (String) The date and time that the volume job was started.If absent, the volume job has not yet started.
	- `status` - (String) The status of this volume job:- `deleting`:   job is being deleted- `failed`:     job could not be completed successfully- `queued`:     job is queued- `running`:    job is in progress- `succeeded`:  job was completed successfully- `canceling`: job is being canceled- `canceled`:  job is canceledThe enumerated values for this property may[expand](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/vpc#property-value-expansion) in the future.
	  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `canceled`, `canceling`, `deleting`, `failed`, `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`. The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*$/`.
