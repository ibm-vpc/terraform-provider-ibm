# ibm\_kms_key

Import the details of existing hs-crypto or key-protect keys as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax. Retreives a list of keys from the hs-crypto or key-protect instance for the provided key name or alias name (if created for the key). Configuration of an ibm_kms_key datasource requires that the region parameter is set for the IBM provider in the provider block to be the same as the target key protect instance location/region. If not specified it will default to us-south. A terraform apply will fail if the key protect instance location is set differently.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ibm_kms_key" "test" {
  instance_id = "guid-of-keyprotect-or hs-crypto-instance"
  key_name = "name-of-key"
}
OR
data "ibm_kms_key" "test" {
  instance_id = "guid-of-keyprotect-or hs-crypto-instance"
  alias = "alias_name"
}
resource "ibm_cos_bucket" "flex-us-south" {
  bucket_name          = "atest-bucket"
  resource_instance_id = "cos-instance-id"
  region_location      = "us-south"
  storage_class        = "flex"
  key_protect          = data.ibm_kms_key.test.key.0.crn
}
```

**NOTE : Data of the key can be retrieved either using a key name or an alias name (if created for the key or keys) .

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `instance_id` - (Required, string) The keyprotect instance guid.
* `key_name` - (Required, In conflict with alias_name, string) The name of the key. Only the keys with matching name will be retreived.
* `alias` - (Required, In conflict with key_name, string) The alias name associated with the key. Only the key with matching alias name will be retreived.
* `endpoint_type` - (Optional, string) The type of the endpoint (public or private) to be used for fetching keys.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `keys` - List of all Keys in the IBM hs-crypto or Key-protect instance.
  * `name` - The name for the key.
  * `aliases` - List of all the alias associated with the keys.
  * `id` - The unique identifier for this key
  * `key_ring_id` - The key ring id for the key.
  * `crn` - The crn of the key.
  * `standard_key` - This flag is true in case of standard key, else false for root key.
  * `policy` - The policies associated with the key.
    * `rotation` - The key rotation time interval in months, with a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 12.
      * `created_by` - The unique identifier for the resource that created the policy.
      * `creation_date` - The date the policy was created. The date format follows RFC 3339.
      * `id` - The v4 UUID used to uniquely identify the policy resource, as specified by RFC 4122.
      * `interval_month` - The key rotation time interval in months.
      * `last_update_date` - The date when the policy was last replaced or modified. The date format follows RFC 3339.
      * `updated_by` - The unique identifier for the resource that updated the policy.
    * `dual_auth_delete` - The data associated with the dual authorization delete policy.
      * `created_by` - The unique identifier for the resource that created the policy.
      * `creation_date` - The date the policy was created. The date format follows RFC 3339.
      * `id` - The v4 UUID used to uniquely identify the policy resource, as specified by RFC 4122.
      * `enabled` - If set to true, Key Protect enables a dual authorization policy on the key.
      * `last_update_date` - The date when the policy was last replaced or modified. The date format follows RFC 3339.
      * `updated_by` - The unique identifier for the resource that updated the policy.
