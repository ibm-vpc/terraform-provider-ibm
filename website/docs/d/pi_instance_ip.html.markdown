# ibm\_pi_instance_ip

Import the details of an existing IBM Power Virtual Server instance as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_instance_ip" "ds_instance_ip" {
  pi_instance_name     = "terraform-test-instance"
  pi_network_name = "APP"
  pi_cloud_instance_id = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
}
```
## Notes:
* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`
  Example Usage:
  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
