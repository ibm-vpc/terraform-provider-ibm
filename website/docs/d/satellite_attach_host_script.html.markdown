# ibm\_satellite_attach_host_script

Import the details of an existing IBM satellite location registration script as a data source. Creates a script to run on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or AWS EC2 host in your on-premises infrastructure. The script attaches the host to your IBM Cloud Satellite location. The host must have access to the public network in order for the script to complete.

## Example Usage

###  Create satellite host script to attach IBM host to satellite control plane

```terraform
data "ibm_satellite_attach_host_script" "script" {
  location          = var.location
  labels            = var.labels
  host_provider     = "ibm"
}
```

###  Create satellite host script to attach AWS EC2 host to satellite control plane

```terraform
data "ibm_satellite_attach_host_script" "script" {
  location          = var.location
  labels            = var.labels
  script_dir        = "/tmp"
