# ibm_cis_rate_limit

Provides a IBM CIS Ratelimiting resource. This resource is associated with an IBM Cloud Internet Services instance and a CIS Domain resource. It allows to create, update, delete custom ratelimits of a domain of a CIS instance

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Add a rate limit to the domain

resource "ibm_cis_rate_limit" "ratelimit" {
    cis_id = data.ibm_cis.cis.id
    domain_id = data.ibm_cis_domain.cis_domain.domain_id
    threshold = 20
    period = 900
    match {
        request {
            url = "*.example.org/path*"
            schemes = ["HTTP", "HTTPS"]
            methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "HEAD"]
        }
        response {
            status = [200, 201, 202, 301, 429]
            origin_traffic = false
        }
    }
    action {
        mode = "ban"
        timeout = 43200
        response {
            content_type = "text/plain"
            body = "custom response body"
        }
    }
    correlate {
        by = "nat"
    }
    disabled = false
    description = "example rate limit for a zone"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `cis_id` - (Required,string) The ID of the CIS service instance
- `domain_id` - (Required,string) The ID of the domain to add the Rate Limit rule.
- `threshold` - (Required,int). The threshold that triggers the rate limit mitigations, combined with period. For example, threshold per period. Min value: 2, max value: 1000000.
- `period` - (Required,int). The time, in seconds, to count matching traffic. If the count exceeds threshold within this period the action is performed. Min value:1, max value: 3600.
- `match` - (Optional,list). Determines which traffic the rate limiting rule counts towards the threshold.
  - `request` - (Optional,list). Matches HTTP requests.If not provided API ll default request to \* , [_ALL_], `_ALL_` respectively.
    - `url` - (Optional,string). The URL pattern to match comprised of the host and path, for instance, example.org/path. Wildcards are expanded to match applicable traffic, query strings are not matched. Use \* for all traffic to your zone. Max length is 1024.
    - `schemes` - (Optional,set(string)). HTTP Schemes, can be one [HTTPS], both [HTTP,HTTPS] or all [_ALL_]. This field is not required.
    - `methods` - (Optional,set(string)). HTTP Methods, can be a subset [POST,PUT] or all [_ALL_]. This field is not required to create a rate limit rule. Valid values are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `_ALL_`.
  - `response` - (Optional,list). Matches HTTP responses before they are returned to the client . If this is defined, then the entire counting of traffic occurs at this stage.
    - `status` - (Optional,set(int)). HTTP Status codes, can be one [403], many [401,403] or indicate all by not providing this value. This field is not required. Min value: 100, max value: 999.
    - `origin_traffic` - (Optional,bool). Orrigin traffic.
    - `header` - (Optional,list). Array of response headers to match. If a response does not meet the header criteria then the request is not counted towards the rate limiting rule. The header matching criteria includes following properties.
      - `name` - (Optional,string). The name of the response header to match.
      - `op` - (Optional,string). The operator when matching, eq means equals, ne means not equals. Valid values are [`eq`] and [`ne`].
      - `value` - (Optional,string). WThe value of the header, which is exactly matched.
- `action` - (Required,list). The action performed when the threshold of matched traffic within the period defined is exceeded.
  - `mode` - (Required,string). The type of action performed. Valid values are: [`simulate`], [`ban`], [`challenge`], [`js_challenge`].
  - `timeout` - (Optional,int). The time, in seconds, as an integer to perform the mitigation action. Timeout be the same or greater than the period. This field is valid only when mode is [`simulate`] or [`ban`]. Min value: 10, max value: 86400.
  - `response` - (Optional,list). Custom content-type and body to return. This overrides the custom error for the zone. Omission results in the default HTML error page. This field is valid only when mode is [`simulate`] or [`ban`].
    - `content_type` - (Optional,string). The content-type of the body, which must be one of the following: [`text/plain`], [`text/xml`], [`application/json`].
    - `body` - (Optional,string). The body to return. The content here must conform to the `content_type`. Max length is 10240.
- `disabled` - (Optional,bool). Whether this rate limiting rule is currently disabled.
- `description` - (Optional,string). A note that you can use to describe the reason for a rate limiting rule.
- `correlate` - (Optional,list). Whether to enable NAT based rate limiting.
  - `by` - (Optional,string). Valid values: [`nat`].
- `bypass` - (Optional,list). Criteria that allows the rate limit to be bypassed. For example, to express that you shouldnâ€™t apply a rate limit to a given set of URLs.
  - `name` - (Optional,string). Valid values is [`url`].
  - `value` - (Optional,string). The url to bypass.

**NOTE:** To create a custom rate limit rule the CIS instance should be a `enterprise` plan

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The record ID. It is a combination of <`rule_id`>,<`domain_id`>,<`cis_id`> attributes concatenated with ":".
- `rule_id` - The Rate Limit Rule ID.

## Import

The `ibm_cis_rate_limit` resource can be imported using the `id`. The ID is formed from the `Rate Limit rule ID`, the `Domain ID` of the domain and the `CRN` (Cloud Resource Name) concatentated using a `:` character.

The Domain ID and CRN will be located on the **Overview** page of the Internet Services instance under the **Domain** heading of the UI, or via using the `bx cis` CLI commands.

- **Domain ID** is a 32 digit character string of the form: `9caf68812ae9b3f0377fdf986751a78f`

- **CRN** is a 120 digit character string of the form: `crn:v1:bluemix:public:internet-svcs:global:a/4ea1882a2d3401ed1e459979941966ea:31fa970d-51d0-4b05-893e-251cba75a7b3::`

- **Rate Limit rule ID** is a 32 digit character string of the form: `489d96f0da6ed76251b475971b097205c`.
