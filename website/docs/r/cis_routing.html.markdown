# ibm_cis_routing

Provides a IBM CIS Routing resource. This resource is associated with an IBM Cloud Internet Services instance and a CIS Domain resource. It allows to change Routing of a domain of a CIS instance

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Change Routing of the domain

resource "ibm_cis_routing" "routing" {
	cis_id          = data.ibm_cis.cis.id
	domain_id       = data.ibm_cis_domain.cis_domain.domain_id
	smart_routing   = "on"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `cis_id` - (Required,string) The ID of the CIS service instance.
- `domain_id` - (Required,string) The ID of the domain to change routing.
- `smart_routing` - (Optional, string) The smart routing enable/disable setting. Valid values are `on` and `off`.

**NOTE:**  `tiered_caching` is not supported yet.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The record ID. It is a combination of <`domain_id`>,<`cis_id`> attributes concatenated with ":".

## Import

The `ibm_cis_routing` resource can be imported using the `id`. The ID is formed from the `Domain ID` of the domain and the `CRN` (Cloud Resource Name) concatentated using a `:` character.

The Domain ID and CRN will be located on the **Overview** page of the Internet Services instance under the **Domain** heading of the UI, or via using the `ibmcloud cis` CLI commands.

- **Domain ID** is a 32 digit character string of the form: `9caf68812ae9b3f0377fdf986751a78f`

- **CRN** is a 120 digit character string of the form: `crn:v1:bluemix:public:internet-svcs:global:a/4ea1882a2d3401ed1e459979941966ea:31fa970d-51d0-4b05-893e-251cba75a7b3::`
