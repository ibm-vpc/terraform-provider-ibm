# ibm\_iam_user_invite

Provides a resource for IAM User Invite. This allows batch of users or single user to be invited, updated and deleted. User to be invited can be added to one or more access groups

## Example Usage

### Inviting batch of Users

```terraform
resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
}

```

### Inviting batch of Users with access groups

```terraform
resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users         = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  access_groups = ["accessgroup-id-9876543210"]
}

```

### Inviting batch of Users with Classic Infrastructure roles

#### Inviting batch of Users with Classic Infrastructure permissions

```terraform
resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  classic_infra_roles {
    permissions = ["PORT_CONTROL", "DATACENTER_ACCESS"]
  }
}

```

#### Inviting batch of Users with Classic Infrastructure permission set

```terraform
resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  classic_infra_roles {
    permission_set = "superuser"
  }
}

```


### User invite with access IAM policies

#### Inviting batch of Users with User Policy for All Identity and Access enabled services

```terraform
resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  iam_policy {
    roles = ["Viewer"]
  }
}

```

#### Inviting batch of Users with User Policy using service with region

```terraform
resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  iam_policy {
    roles = ["Viewer"]
    resources {
      service = "kms"
    }
  }
}

```

#### Inviting batch of Users with User Policy using resource instance

```terraform
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "instance" {
  name     = "test"
  service  = "kms"
  plan     = "tiered-pricing"
  location = "us-south"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  iam_policy {
    roles = ["Manager", "Viewer", "Administrator"]
    resources {
      service              = "kms"
      resource_instance_id = element(split(":", ibm_resource_instance.instance.id), 7)
    }
  }
}

```

#### Inviting batch of Users with User Policy using resource group

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "default"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  iam_policy {
    roles = ["Manager", "Viewer", "Administrator"]
    resources {
      service           = "containers-kubernetes"
      resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
    }
  }
}

```

#### Inviting batch of Users with User Policy using resource and resource type

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "default"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  iam_policy {
    roles = ["Manager", "Viewer", "Administrator"]
    resources {
      resource_type = "resource-group"
      resource      = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
    }
  }
}

```

#### Inviting batch of Users with User Policy using attributes

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "default"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  iam_policy {
    roles = ["Manager", "Viewer", "Administrator"]
    resources {
      service = "is"
      attributes = {
        "vpcId" = "*"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### User invite with access cloud foundry roles

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
}

data "ibm_org" "org" {
  org = var.org
}

data "ibm_space" "space" {
  org   = var.org
  space = var.space
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_invite" "invite_user" {
  users = ["test@in.ibm.com"]
  cloud_foundry_roles {
    organization_guid = data.ibm_org.org.id
    org_roles         = ["Manager", "Auditor"]
    spaces {
      space_guid  = data.ibm_space.space.id
      space_roles = ["Manager", "Developer"]
