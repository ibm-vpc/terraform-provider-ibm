# ibm\_is_dedicated_host

Provides a resource for DedicatedHost. This allows DedicatedHost to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_dedicated_host_group" "dh_group01" {
  family = "memory"
  class = "beta"
  zone = "us-south-1"
}
data "ibm_is_dedicated_host_group" "dgroup" {
  name = ibm_is_dedicated_host_group.dh_group01.name
}
resource "ibm_is_dedicated_host" "is_dedicated_host" {
  profile = "dh2-56x464"
  host_group = "1e09281b-f177-46fb-baf1-bc152b2e391a"
  name = "testdh02"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `instance_placement_enabled` - (Optional, bool) If set to true, instances can be placed on this dedicated host.
* `name` - (Optional, string) The unique user-defined name for this dedicated host. If unspecified, the name will be a hyphenated list of randomly-selected words.
* `profile` - (Required, string) The Globally unique name of the dedicated host profile to use for this dedicated host.
* `resource_group` - (Optional, string) The unique identifier of the resource group to use. If unspecified, the account's [default resourcegroup](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-manager#introduction) is used.
* `host_group` - (Required, string) The unique identifier of the dedicated host group for this dedicated host.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The unique identifier of the DedicatedHost.
* `available_memory` - The amount of memory in gibibytes that is currently available for instances.
* `available_vcpu` - The available VCPU for the dedicated host.
* `created_at` - The date and time that the dedicated host was created.
* `crn` - The CRN for this dedicated host.
* `disks` - Collection of the dedicated host's disks. Nested `disks` blocks have the following structure:
	* `available` - The remaining space left for instance placement in GB (gigabytes).
	* `created_at` - The date and time that the disk was created.
	* `href` - The URL for this disk.
	* `id` - The unique identifier for this disk.
	* `instance_disks` - Instance disks that are on this dedicated host disk. Nested `instance_disks` blocks have the following structure:
		* `deleted` - If present, this property indicates the referenced resource has been deleted and providessome supplementary information. Nested `deleted` blocks have the following structure:
			* `more_info` - Link to documentation about deleted resources.
		* `href` - The URL for this instance disk.
		* `id` - The unique identifier for this instance disk.
		* `name` - The user-defined name for this disk.
		* `resource_type` - The resource type.
	* `interface_type` - The disk interface used for attaching the diskThe enumerated values for this property are expected to expand in the future. When processing this property, check for and log unknown values. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the resource on which the unexpected property value was encountered.
	* `lifecycle_state` - The lifecycle state of this dedicated host disk.
	* `name` - The user-defined or system-provided name for this disk.
	* `provisionable` - Indicates whether this dedicated host disk is available for instance disk creation.
	* `resource_type` - The type of resource referenced.

* `href` - The URL for this dedicated host.
* `instance_placement_enabled` - If set to true, instances can be placed on this dedicated host.
* `instances` - Array of instances that are allocated to this dedicated host.
  * `crn` - The CRN for this virtual server instance.
	* `deleted` - If present, this property indicates the referenced resource has been deleted and providessome supplementary information. Nested `deleted` blocks have the following structure:
