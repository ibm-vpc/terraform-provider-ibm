# ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip

Provides a subnet reserved IP resource. This allows Subnet reserved IP to be created, updated, and deleted.

## Example Usage

In the following example, you can create a Reserved IP:

```terraform
    // Create a VPC
    resource "ibm_is_vpc" "vpc1" {
        name = "my-vpc"
    }

    // Create a subnet
    resource "ibm_is_subnet" "subnet1" {
        name                     = "my-subnet"
        vpc                      = ibm_is_vpc.vpc1.id
        zone                     = "us-south-1"
        total_ipv4_address_count = 256
    }

    // Create the resrved IP in the following ways

    // Only with Subnet ID
    resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "res_ip" {
        subnet = ibm_is_subnet.subnet1.id
    }

    // Subnet ID with a given name
    resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "res_ip_name" {
        subnet = ibm_is_subnet.subnet1.id
        name = "my-subnet-reserved-ip"
    }

    // Subnet ID with auto_delete
    resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "res_ip_auto_delete" {
        subnet = ibm_is_subnet.subnet1.id
        auto_delete = true
    }

    // Subnet ID with both name and auto_delete
    resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "res_ip_auto_delete_name" {
        subnet = ibm_is_subnet.subnet1.id
        name = "my-subnet-reserved-ip"
        auto_delete = true
    }

        // Create a virtual endpoint gateway and set as a target for reserved IP
    resource "ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateway" "endpoint_gateway" {
        name = "my-endpoint-gateway-1"
        target {
            name          = "ibm-ntp-server"
            resource_type = "provider_infrastructure_service"
        }
        vpc = ibm_is_vpc.vpc1.id
    }
    resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "reserved_ip_1" {
        subnet = ibm_is_subnet.subnet1.id
        name = "%s"
        target = ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateway.endpoint_gateway.id
    }
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `subnet` - (Required, Forces new resource, string) The subnet id for the reserved IP.
* `name` - (Optional, string) The name of the reserved IP.
    **NOTE**: Raise error if name is given with a prefix `ibm-`.
* `auto_delete` - (Optional, boolean) If reserved IP is auto deleted.
* `target` - (Optional, string) The id for the target endpoint gateway for the reserved IP.


## Attribure Reference

* `id` - The combination of the subnet ID and reserved IP ID seperated by '/'.
* `reserved_ip` - This refers to only the reserved IP.
* `created_at` -The date and time that the reserved IP was created.",
* `href` - The URL for this reserved IP.
* `owner` - The owner of a reserved IP, defining whether it is managed by the user or the provider.
* `resource_type` - The resource type.
* `address` - The IP address.
* `target` - The id for the target endpoint gateway for the reserved IP.

## Import

ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip can be imported using subnet ID and reserved IP ID seperated by '/' eg
