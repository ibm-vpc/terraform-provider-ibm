# ibm_is_volume_job

Create, update, and delete is_volume_jobs with this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_volume_job" "is_volume_job_instance" {
  job_type = "migrate"
  name = "my-volume-job"
  parameters {
		bandwidth = 1000
		iops = 10000
		profile {
			name = "general-purpose"
		}
  }
  volume_id = "volume_id"
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this resource.

- `job_type` - (Required, String) The type of volume job.The enumerated values for this property may[expand](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/vpc#property-value-expansion) in the future.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `migrate`. The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*$/`.

		  * Constraints: The maximum length is `63` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^([a-z]|[a-z][-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9]|[0-9][-a-z0-9]*([a-z]|[-a-z][-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9]))$/`.
- `start` - (Optional, String) A server-provided token determining what resource to start the page on.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `4096` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[ -~]+$/`.
- `volume_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The volume identifier.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z_]+$/`.

## Attribute Reference

After your resource is created, you can read values from the listed arguments and the following attributes.

## Import

You can import the `ibm_is_volume_job` resource by using `id`.
The `id` property can be formed from `volume_id`, and `is_volume_job_id` in the following format:

<pre>
&lt;volume_id&gt;/&lt;is_volume_job_id&gt;
</pre>
- `volume_id`: A string. The volume identifier.
- `is_volume_job_id`: A string in the format `r006-095e9baf-01d4-4e29-986e-20d26606b82a`. The unique identifier for this volume job.

# Syntax
<pre>
$ terraform import ibm_is_volume_job.is_volume_job &lt;volume_id&gt;/&lt;is_volume_job_id&gt;
</pre>
