# ibm\_kms_key_alias

Provides a key management resource for hs-crypto and key-protect services. This allows aliases for the keys to be created, and deleted.

## Example usage to provision Key Protect service and Key Management With Alias

```terraform
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "kms_instance" {
  name     = "instance-name"
  service  = "kms"
  plan     = "tiered-pricing"
  location = "us-south"
}
resource "ibm_kms_key" "test" {
  instance_id  = ibm_resource_instance.kms_instance.guid
  key_name     = "key-name"
  standard_key = false
  force_delete =true
}
resource "ibm_kms_key_alias" "key_alias" {
    instance_id = ibm_kms_key.test.instance_id
    alias  = "alias"
    key_id = "ibm_kms_key.test.key_id"
}
resource "ibm_cos_bucket" "flex-us-south" {
  bucket_name          = "atest-bucket"
  resource_instance_id = "cos-instance-id"
  region_location      = "us-south"
  storage_class        = "flex"
  key_protect          = ibm_kms_key.test.id
}
```

Note : An alias that identifies a key. Each alias is unique only within the given instance and is not reserved across the Key Protect service. Each key can have up to five aliases. There is a limit of 1000 aliases per instance. Alias must be alphanumeric and cannot contain spaces or special characters other than '-' or '_'.
